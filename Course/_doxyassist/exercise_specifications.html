<h2>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course project is an exiting board game ? working title
Colonizing Pirkanmaa. You can affect the game you will implement in
many ways. The goal of the game is nonetheless for the players to gain
new land on the mythical land of Pirkanmaa.</p>

<h2>Gameplay<a class="headerlink" href="#gameplay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An expedition has returned from far north and is spreading stories of a
mythical land hidden in the wilderness. This land is abundant in resources
and has peaked interest of many citizens and merchants of neighbouring
cities and countries.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. The race for the colonization of Pirkanmaa has begun.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The game contains ready-made parts. These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>buildings<ul>
<li>farm</li>
<li>headquarters</li>
<li>outpost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tiles<ul>
<li>forest</li>
<li>grassland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>workers<ul>
<li>basicworker</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition a rudimentary class for drawing the game map is given. You can use it in the beginning of project implementation.</p>
<p>The team needs to implement the graphical user interface, saving the game objects, player actions, goals of the game, managing the state of the game and statistics. Below a rough example of what the GUI of the game might look like:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://plus.tuni.fi/graderD/static/tie0240x-a2019/_images/UI-Example.jpg"><img alt="../../_images/UI-Example.jpg" src="https://plus.tuni.fi/graderD/static/tie0240x-a2019/_images/UI-Example.jpg" style="width: 946.5500000000001px; height: 589.6px;"/></a>
</div>
<p>Many details of the game are left intentionally open and you can implement them as you wish. These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The goals of the game: How the game ends and how success is defined?</li>
<li>GUI: What the map looks like? How different actions in the game can be done?</li>
<li>The start situation: What game pieces/resources the player has in the beginning and how they are placed in the game?</li>
<li>Own game mechanics: Do the game objects have any special actions? Can the players trade with each other?</li>
<li>Game state: Whose turn it is? When the game ends?</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Gameplay<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following order of actions depicts the start and funtionality of the game. This is an example. Your game can be different from what is depicted here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The game starts with the help of a self-implemented main program. The game asks with a separate configuration window the number of players and other information needed by the game. After this the main window implemented by the group is opened. On it, there is the game board with tiles, the players gamepieces and other necessary information.</li>
<li>The player starts the game by clicking a game piece in the main window.</li>
<li>The player chooses a game piece or pieces to move and the tile they move to. The pieces move on the board.</li>
<li>The player chooses a tile where they build an outpost.</li>
<li>The player chooses a tile where they add a worker.</li>
<li>The player end their turn, the next player starts their turn.</li>
<li>The game ends when Pirkanmaa has been colonialized. The player with most land and resources wins the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#hints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Check what is implemented on the course side</li>
<li>When designing the project:<ul>
<li>Make your own class diagram that clarifies the structure and division of work</li>
<li>Go the functionality of the game through with the help of the class diagram and/or sequence diagram</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start coding only once you have a clear plan in order to be able to concentrate on solving codebased problems</li>
<li>You can inherit own versions of course library buildings, tiles and workers if you what to modify costs, production or add functionality</li>
<li>All game objects can be given additional text based metadata</li>
<li>You can ask for bug corrections and additions to the course code<ul>
<li>NOTE! Additions to the library should be asked as early as possible in order to allow enough time to implement them. Do the design early and with care.</li>
